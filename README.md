# webp-recompress
Experimental project that tries to compress image to webp using perceptual difference (SSIM), inspired by jpeg-recompress (https://github.com/danielgtaylor/jpeg-archive).

Based on SSIM code by ladinu at https://github.com/ladinu/go-ssim

Results show less savings as compared to the study done by Google.
